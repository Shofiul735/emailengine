            EmailEngine is email client software designed for applications, not
            individual users. It connects to users' email servers and translates REST API requests from applications into
            IMAP and SMTP commands, or Gmail API and Microsoft Graph API requests. Additionally, it sends webhooks
            to notify applications of events such as new or deleted emails.
